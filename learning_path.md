## Python
My jurney started when I decided to learn programing. After some research I came to the conclusion that I want to learn Python. I took two courses in parallel:
* ["Introduction to Python"](https://openstudies.vdu.lt/dalykai/informatikos-mokslai/programavimo-ivadas/) at Vytautas Magnus University
* ["Learn Python 3"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) at Codecademy

I learned all the basics about Standard data types, Conditional statements, Iterations, Functional programing, Objected Oriented Programming (OOP), Exceptions, Files, GUI, Regex and so on.
## Data Science
Straight after I finished Python course I started to focus on Data Science.
